# Fluent Bit with Kubernetes
This respository contains the configurations, test data, utilities for the Manning book Fluent Bit with Kubernetes.  The book is still in development but will become available soon as part of the Manning Early Accesss Programmer (MEAP) soon.

## About the Book
The book looks at the application and configuration of Fluent Bit v2 onwards.

It is being written as a partner title to Logging In Action (although you don't need to have read Logging in Action) to benefit from this book.
